            This Agreement contains provisions that govern and limit how claims you and the Sender
            have against each other are resolved. It also contains an agreement to arbitrate, which will,
            with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final
            arbitration. You will only be permitted to pursue claims against the Sender on an individual
            basis, not as part of any class or representative action or proceeding, and you will only be
            permitted to seek relief on an individual basis.

              You authorize Sender to use auto dialer or non-auto dialer technology to send text
              messages to the cell phone number associated with your Opt-In. You also authorize Sender
              to include marketing content in any such messages. You do not have to Opt-In as a
              condition of purchase of any of Sender's offerings.
            </li>
            <li>
              You confirm that you are the subscriber to the relevant phone number, or that you are the

              Unless otherwise noted, Sender may send multiple recurring messages and frequency may

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-display text-ink">Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <ul class="mt-3 list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
            <li>
              Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to the Platform will be resolved
              by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small
              claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law
              apply to these Terms and Conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              By agreeing to arbitration, you waive your right to maintain other available resolution
              processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes or claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a demand to the American Arbitration
              Association describing your claim and serve a copy of the demand to {sender} at
              <a href={contactPageHref} class="underline hover:no-underline"> {contactPageHref}</a>.
              AAA rules and filing forms are available at
              <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline hover:no-underline"> www.adr.org</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              You and Sender agree that any dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an
              individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
            </li>
            <li>
              If any claim proceeds in court rather than arbitration, you and Sender each waive any
              right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable.
            </li>
            <li>
              You and Sender may bring suit in court to seek to enjoin infringement or other misuse of
              intellectual property rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              If any term of this section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that
              does not affect any other term or provision in any other jurisdiction. These dispute
              resolution provisions survive cancellation or termination of your agreement to engage with
              the Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sender's third-party service providers are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and
              Conditions, including with respect to the dispute resolution procedures.

              New Platform features, changes, updates, or improvements are subject to these Terms unless

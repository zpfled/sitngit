# Sit & Git Portables — Conversion-Focused Site Roadmap

Purpose: Make Sit & Git feel like the obvious, low‑risk choice for Southwest Wisconsin portable sanitation rentals before visitors compare prices.

---

## Global checklist (sitewide)
- [ ] Remove price‑first messaging from any global components (header/hero/CTA blocks)
- [ ] Use “reliability, predictability, professionalism” framing across all primary pages
- [ ] Standardize CTA language: “Reserve Service” (primary), “Request Institutional Quote” (secondary)
- [ ] Add service‑area emphasis in headers/footers (Southwest Wisconsin + key counties/metros)
- [ ] Add trust signals in header/footer: “10+ 5‑star Google reviews” + “Owner‑operated”

---

## Homepage

### Above the fold (priority content)
- [ ] **Headline (example)**: “The safe, default choice for portable sanitation in Southwest Wisconsin.”
- [ ] **Subheadline (example)**: “Owner‑operated, on‑time service for parks, schools, municipalities, contractors, and events — with predictable scheduling and professional delivery.”
- [ ] **Primary CTA**: “Reserve Service” (button)
- [ ] **Secondary CTA**: “Request Institutional Quote” (text link)
- [ ] **Trust strip**: “10+ 5‑star Google reviews” + “Local owner/operator” + “On‑time delivery”
- [ ] **Service‑area micro‑line**: “Serving Southwest Wisconsin — [counties/metros].”

### Hero rewrite (positioning as safe/default choice)
- [ ] Replace generic “portable toilet rentals” phrasing with authority: “default choice,” “predictable schedules,” “professional delivery.”
- [ ] Remove “lowest price” or “budget” language anywhere in hero.
- [ ] Keep ADA as optional: “Premium ADA units available on request.”

### Authority‑driven messaging (replace generic service language)
- [ ] Replace “we offer clean, reliable units” with outcome statements:
  - “Units arrive on time and stay serviced on schedule.”
  - “One point of contact, no hand‑offs.”
  - “We handle parks, schools, and municipal compliance schedules.”
- [ ] Use “default choice” framing in 1–2 sections only (avoid repetition).

### Homepage structure (section checklist)
- [ ] **Section 1: Who we serve** — parks/schools, municipalities, contractors, events (4 tiles)
- [ ] **Section 2: Why default choice** — 3 proof points (predictable scheduling, owner‑operated accountability, professional delivery)
- [ ] **Section 3: Review proof** — embedded Google reviews + short quote cards
- [ ] **Section 4: Service process** — 3 steps (Schedule → Deliver → Maintain)
- [ ] **Section 5: Coverage** — map or list of service area + “local, fast response” line
- [ ] **Section 6: CTA block** — Reserve Service / Request Institutional Quote

## Page structure & navigation

### Recommended pages
- [ ] **Home** — conversion hub; default choice positioning; trust + CTA
- [ ] **Long‑Term Rentals** — contractors + ongoing sites; service cadence & reliability
- [ ] **Events** — one‑time rentals; scheduling certainty + availability urgency
- [ ] **Parks & Schools** — institutional decision makers; predictability + accountability
- [ ] **Municipalities** (optional split from Parks & Schools if volume warrants) — public works, compliance‑oriented language
- [ ] **ADA / Premium Options** — optional upgrades only; not default
- [ ] **Reviews** — centralized trust hub; review snippets + Google profile link
- [ ] **Contact / Request Quote** — form segmentation

### Navigation priorities
- [ ] Keep nav to 5–6 items max: Home, Long‑Term, Events, Parks & Schools, ADA/Premium, Contact
- [ ] Add “Reviews” in footer or secondary nav only

### Purpose of each page in funnel
- [ ] **Home**: establish default choice + funnel to segment pages
- [ ] **Long‑Term**: reassure contractors about schedule certainty and accountability
- [ ] **Events**: reduce risk of last‑minute failures; add urgency cue
- [ ] **Parks & Schools**: institutional trust, predictability, compliance‑friendly framing
- [ ] **Municipalities** (if separate): procurement‑friendly wording, reliability emphasis
- [ ] **ADA/Premium**: upsell; clarify optional add‑on, not baseline
- [ ] **Reviews**: trust reinforcement before conversion
- [ ] **Contact**: conversion endpoint

## Pricing presentation

### Framing checklist
- [ ] Lead with **bundles** (outcomes) before line items
- [ ] Emphasize **predictable service** before any numbers
- [ ] Use “starting at” ranges only after qualification language
- [ ] Avoid side‑by‑side price comparisons
- [ ] Add “pricing depends on service cadence + site needs” statement

### Suggested structure
- [ ] **Bundle labels**: “Standard Ongoing Service,” “Event‑Ready Package,” “Institutional Schedule”
- [ ] **Bundle includes**: delivery, regular servicing, removal
- [ ] **Line items**: delivery fee, service cadence, add‑ons (after bundle)
- [ ] **ADA/Premium**: separate add‑on callout with “optional” label

---

## Reviews & trust integration

### Placement
- [ ] Homepage above mid‑page (after “Why default choice”)
- [ ] Pricing/Quote page near form
- [ ] Parks & Schools page near CTA
- [ ] Footer: “10+ 5‑star Google reviews” badge/link

### Usage guidelines
- [ ] Use 3–5 short review excerpts on homepage
- [ ] Link to full Google reviews from Reviews page and footer
- [ ] For outreach credibility: include review snippets in PDF/printable quote (future)

### Responding to reviews (SEO signaling)
- [ ] Use location and service terms naturally: “Thanks for choosing us for your [town] event.”
- [ ] Mention reliability/predictability: “Glad our on‑time delivery helped.”
- [ ] Keep responses short, consistent tone, and owner‑signed

---

## Conversion mechanics

### CTAs
- [ ] **Primary**: “Reserve Service” (global header + hero + bottom)
- [ ] **Secondary**: “Request Institutional Quote” (for parks/schools/municipalities)

### Form types
- [ ] **Institutional inquiry form**: organization type, project type, service cadence, location, start date
- [ ] **General quote form**: event date, duration, location, quantity, contact info
- [ ] Add “preferred service start date” to both

### Urgency/scarcity for events
- [ ] Add availability note: “Event weekends book out early — confirm dates now.”
- [ ] Add “date needed” field validation to surface scarcity
- [ ] Place a small “calendar fill rate” note (text only, no graphics)

---

## SEO & local authority

### High‑intent keyword themes (use naturally)
- [ ] “portable toilet rental Southwest Wisconsin”
- [ ] “portable restroom rental [city/county]”
- [ ] “event portable toilets Wisconsin”
- [ ] “construction site portable toilets Wisconsin”
- [ ] “park restroom rentals” / “school portable toilets”
- [ ] “ADA portable restroom rental” (as optional)

### Structural SEO improvements
- [ ] H1 only on each page; use service‑area + segment in H1
- [ ] Add service‑area line in page headers/footers
- [ ] Each segment page targets one audience (no keyword stuffing)
- [ ] Internal linking from homepage to segment pages with descriptive anchors
- [ ] Add FAQ blocks per page (2–4 Qs) using audience‑specific phrasing
